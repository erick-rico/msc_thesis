# References and notes – Stage 1

## Data sources

- RAMA (Red Automática de Monitoreo Atmosférico), Mexico City

## Notes and considerations

- Monthly p90 thresholds are used for **exploratory purposes only** in Stage 1.
- Event definitions will be revisited after data harmonization and sensitivity testing.
- Diurnal PM diagnostics are intended as **descriptive indicators**, not causal attribution.
- Station coverage varies by year; analyses rely on network-wide maxima rather than fixed stations.
- All interpretations at this stage are preliminary.

## To be added in later stages

- ENSO indices (Niño-3.4, MEI)
- Boundary-layer and ventilation proxies
- Synoptic regime literature focused on Central Mexico
