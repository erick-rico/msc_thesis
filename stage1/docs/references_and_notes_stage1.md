## Notes and harmonic analysis

- Diurnal (24h) and semidiurnal (12h) harmonics are fitted to **monthly hourly climatologies**.
- Harmonic plots represent **mean behavior**, not extremes.
- Official thresholds are not expected to be crossed in climatological harmonic plots because:
  - extremes are diluted by long-term averaging,
  - contingency thresholds target rare tail events (p95–p99),
  - and extreme PM episodes require multi-day stagnation.

## Notes on official thresholds

- **NOM-172**  
  Defines air-quality categories based on NowCast concentrations.

- **PCAA (Programa para Prevenir y Responder a Contingencias Ambientales Atmosféricas)**  
  Defines Phase I and Phase II contingencies using 24-hour moving averages (MA24).

These thresholds are retained for **policy-oriented comparison**, not as the main episode definition, due to limited sample sizes and heterogeneous synoptic signatures.

## Methodological decision (Stage 1 outcome)

The thesis proceeds with:
- daily city-mean PM data,
- percentile-based episode definitions,
- and circulation-focused interpretation.

Alternative definitions are treated as sensitivity analyses to ensure robustness without compromising methodological consistency or feasibility.
