# Research questions – Stage 1 context

## Core research questions

- **RQ0.** What synoptic and sub-seasonal circulation patterns are associated with extreme
  PM₂.₅ and PM₁₀ episodes over the Valley of Mexico, and how are these patterns modulated by ENSO?

- **RQ1.** Which circulation regimes are most frequently associated with extreme PM₂.₅ and PM₁₀ events,
  and how do their composite signatures differ?

- **RQ2.** What are the typical boundary-layer stability and ventilation characteristics during
  PM episodes versus non-episode days?

- **RQ3.** Do monthly and intraseasonal composites reveal background conditions that
  “precondition” PM episodes beyond event-day anomalies?

- **RQ4.** How do episode frequency and composite patterns differ between El Niño,
  La Niña, and neutral conditions?

## Role of Stage 1

Stage 1 addresses **RQ0 indirectly** by:
- testing event definitions,
- exploring monthly background circulation,
- identifying whether meaningful synoptic signals emerge.

The diurnal PM diagnostics provide **contextual support** for RQ2 by describing
when PM extremes tend to occur within the daily cycle.

No research question is conclusively answered at this stage; instead,
Stage 1 establishes the analytical foundation for later stages.
