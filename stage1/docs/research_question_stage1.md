# Research questions – Stage 1 context

## Core research questions

- **RQ0.** What synoptic and sub-seasonal circulation patterns are associated with extreme
  PM₂.₅ and PM₁₀ episodes over the Valley of Mexico, and how are these patterns modulated by ENSO?

- **RQ1.** Which circulation regimes are most frequently associated with extreme PM₂.₅ and PM₁₀ events,
  and how do their composite signatures differ?

- **RQ2.** What are the typical boundary-layer stability and ventilation characteristics during
  PM episodes versus non-episode days?

- **RQ3.** Do monthly and intraseasonal composites reveal background conditions that
  “precondition” PM episodes beyond event-day anomalies?

- **RQ4.** How do episode frequency and composite patterns differ between El Niño,
  La Niña, and neutral conditions?

## Rationale

This thesis focuses on linking **extreme particulate matter episodes** to **large-scale atmospheric circulation**, rather than on local emission diagnostics or operational air-quality management.

Accordingly, the analysis prioritizes:
- regional-scale signals,
- daily temporal resolution,
- and circulation-consistent episode definitions.

## Episode definition framework

Based on Stage 1 analyses, extreme PM episodes are defined using:

- **Primary definition (thesis core)**  
  Percentile-based extremes (p90) computed from **daily city-mean PM concentrations**.

- **Sensitivity analyses**
  - Percentiles derived from daily-equivalent series aggregated from hourly RAMA data.
  - Official thresholds from:
    - NOM-172 (NowCast-based categories).
    - PCAA Phase I and Phase II contingency thresholds (MA24).

This framework allows direct comparison between:
- *statistical extremes* (designed for physical inference), and
- *policy-driven thresholds* (designed for public health management).

## Temporal and spatial scope

- **PM data**
  - Daily city-mean PM: 2012–2024.
  - Hourly RAMA PM: 1995–2023 (PM₁₀), 2003–2023 (PM₂.₅).

- **Atmospheric fields**
  - Reanalysis-based circulation fields (e.g., Z500, winds).

- **Climate modulation**
  - ENSO phases used as a modulating factor, not a primary driver.

## Intended contribution

This work aims to:
- identify recurrent synoptic configurations linked to extreme PM events,
- assess their seasonal and intraseasonal structure,
- and evaluate how large-scale climate variability modulates their occurrence.
