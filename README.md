# MSc Thesis – Atmospheric drivers of extreme PM pollution in the Valley of Mexico

This repository documents the MSc thesis workflow of **Erick Rico Esparza**
(Environmental Engineering, Tampere University).

The thesis investigates the **synoptic, sub-seasonal, and climate-scale drivers**
of extreme PM₂.₅ and PM₁₀ pollution episodes over the Valley of Mexico,
with emphasis on circulation regimes and ENSO modulation.

The repository is organized by **analysis stages**, each corresponding to
a defined phase in the thesis schedule.
