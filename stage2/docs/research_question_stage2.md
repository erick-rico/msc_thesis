# Research questions – Stage 2 context

## Core research questions

- **RQ0.** How are extreme PM₂.₅ and PM₁₀ days (monthly p90 definition) distributed in time across 2012–2024 in terms of frequency, severity, and persistence?

- **RQ1.** What large-scale 500 hPa circulation anomalies (Z500′) are systematically associated with extreme PM events over the Valley of Mexico?

- **RQ2.** Do monthly composites reveal coherent dry- versus wet-season contrasts in synoptic forcing?

- **RQ3.** Are extreme PM events characterized by statistically significant differences in upper-level circulation relative to non-event days within the same calendar month?

- **RQ4.** Do focused high-signal months (ranked by frequency and severity) exhibit consistent ridge–trough structures that can serve as a physical baseline for regime classification?

## Rationale

Stage 2 establishes a **climatological and synoptic baseline** before moving to objective regime classification in Stage 3.

The emphasis is on:

- internally consistent event definition,
- seasonal structuring of circulation anomalies,
- statistical robustness of composite signals,
- and physically interpretable large-scale diagnostics.

This stage intentionally avoids expanding into multi-variable diagnostics in order to preserve methodological clarity and coherence.

## Episode definition framework (Stage 2)

Extreme PM episodes are defined using:

- **Primary definition (fixed for Stage 2)**  
  Monthly p90 thresholds computed from **daily city-mean PM concentrations (2012–2024)**.

  A day is classified as extreme if:
  
  > PM ≥ 90th percentile of its calendar month.

This definition:

- preserves the seasonal cycle,
- ensures balanced sampling across months,
- provides sufficient sample size for composite construction,
- aligns directly with monthly anomaly baselines.

No alternative threshold definitions are applied in this stage.

## Analytical structure

Stage 2 proceeds in four steps:

1. **Event climatology**
   - Annual frequency trends
   - Year × month clustering
   - Mean exceedance above threshold
   - Episode persistence statistics

2. **Monthly synoptic composites**
   - Z500′ composites during event days
   - Wind vector diagnostics
   - Welch t-test significance (event vs non-event, within-month)

3. **Focused high-signal months**
   - Transparent ranking by event-day count and mean exceedance
   - Refined composites for interpretability

4. **Seasonal aggregation**
   - DJF / MAM / JJA / SON synthesis
   - Seasonal composite patterns and statistics

## Temporal and spatial scope

- **PM data**
  - Daily city-mean PM₁₀ and PM₂.₅
  - Period: 2012–2024

- **Atmospheric fields**
  - NARR reanalysis
  - 500 hPa geopotential height (Z500)
  - 500 hPa zonal and meridional winds

- **Spatial domain**
  - Mexico-centered domain (12–33°N, 120–85°W)

Stage 2 focuses exclusively on upper-tropospheric circulation.

## Limitations and scope boundaries

Stage 2 does **not** include:

- Boundary-layer stability metrics
- Moisture transport diagnostics (e.g., 850 hPa humidity)
- Precipitation composites
- Lagged composites
- ENSO-phase stratification
- Objective regime classification

These components are intentionally deferred to later stages in order to:

- avoid methodological inflation,
- maintain conceptual clarity,
- and establish a clean circulation baseline first.

Additionally:

- Composite maps are dominated by early-period years (2012–2017) due to declining event frequency.
- Statistical significance identifies circulation differences, not causal mechanisms.
- Results represent mean synoptic structure, not individual extreme cases.

---

## Intended contribution of Stage 2

Stage 2 provides:

- a physically interpretable link between extreme PM events and large-scale ridge–trough structures,
- a clear seasonal contrast between dry- and wet-season dynamics,
- statistical validation of event-related circulation anomalies,
- and a structured baseline for Stage 3 synoptic regime classification.

This stage transitions the thesis from exploratory diagnostics (Stage 1) to structured physical interpretation.
